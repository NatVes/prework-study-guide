# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This guide was created by me as a boot camp student learning HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It's a handy tool to organise knowledge and understand these topics during the prework phase.
I put together this guide because getting through the prework can be tough. Keeping track of key ideas and definitions along the way is a great help in remembering complex concepts and enhancing skills.
Think of it as a solution to the challenge of sorting through lots of information. This guide gives clear and short notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, making learning process smoother.
Making this guide taught me that clear and simple notes are crucial for effective learning. It reinforced the idea that good organization of information helps beginners to master complex things.
